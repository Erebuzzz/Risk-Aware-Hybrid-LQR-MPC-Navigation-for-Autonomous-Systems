# Risk-Aware-Hybrid-LQR-MPC-Navigation-for-Autonomous-Systems
The objective of this project is to design a risk-aware hybrid navigation controller such that the autonomous systems will be able to achieve safety comparable to always-on MPC while maintaining efficiency close to LQR and significantly reducing average computational cost.
